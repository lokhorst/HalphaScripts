# Halpha_notebooks

The notebooks are written by me to take surface brightness estimates and estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for the Dragonfly Telescope as a function of integration time.

The ExtendedHalos notebook calculate the surface brightness of Halpha emission from extended halos, using data from Steidel et al 2011 on Ly alpha emission of the extended halos of LAEs at intermediate redshift.
