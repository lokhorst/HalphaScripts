    "# Loading the EAGLE simulation data\n",
    "\n",
    "Write out the function for loading the EAGLE simulation data.  It checks whether reduced resolution versions have been created already and loads those if it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function called in this script is \"loaddata\".\n",
    "It accepts a limited range of inputs, for the distance at which we are pretending to observe the simulated data and the \"slice width\" of the simulation (which corresponds to the filter width of the H$\\alpha$ NB filter).  The third input is the desired resolution of the image (i.e. binned resolution), which can be anything, but there are a few standards listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "loaddata returns a data tuple which contains [data array, resolution, trimmed original data array shape]. <br>\n",
    "The \"trimmed original data array shape\" is the size of the original data array (32000x32000 from the 100Mpc size simulation) but trimmed by the amount that was needed in order to reduce the resolution of the simulation.  E.g. if the data needs to be reduced by a factor of 7, that does not go evenly into 32000, so before the data resolution is reduced, the data array is trimmed to a slightly smaller size that is factorable by 7.  This is recorded so we can determine the transverse distances accurately for plotting and masking later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An accompanying script, load_data_testing.ipynb, tests the functionality of this script by providing and running some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance:\n",
    "Distance must be one of: 50Mpc, 100Mpc, 200Mpc, or 500Mpc. <br> To expand this range, we will need to add in the cosmology calculator to calculate the distance-arcsecond transverse scaling at that distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slice Width:\n",
    "The EAGLE simulations are projected into slice widths of 5Mpc, covering 20 Mpc of width in total (z = 0 to 20 Mpc).  The desired slice width must be one of: 5Mpc, 10Mpc, 15Mpc, or 20Mpc.  Roughly, this corresponds to filter widths of 1nm to 5nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resolution:\n",
    "You can input any resolution (in arcseconds), but some standards are:  100 arcsec, 500 arcsec, 1000 arcsec"
