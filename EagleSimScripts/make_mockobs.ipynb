    "# Making a mock observation from the EAGLE simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is an example script to lay out the individual steps of making mock observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the EAGLE simulated data.  Specify the distance at which we want to observe the cosmic web i.e. redshift of central wavelength of filter and the resolution that the data should be binned to.  The minimum resolution at 50Mpc away is about 14\".\n",
    "2. Cut out a chunk of the simulated data that corresponds to the Dragonfly FOV.  (switched with step 3 because takes too long for the whole simulation)\n",
    "3. Add the noise to the simulated data to mimic observational noises (includes sky background noise, read out noise, dark current noise, and shot noise).  This depends on the exposure time of the mock observation.\n",
    "4. Plot the data to check and see what it looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ta da!"
