    "# Adding noise to the EAGLE simulations\n",
    "This goal of this notebook is to explore adding noise to the EAGLE simulation to make mock observations.  The main part of this notebook doesn't even use the simulations, it just explores the sources of noise as added to a pretend data set (a circle on a blank background).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through the different types of noise so that it is clear which one dominates the signal.  In particular, we want to explore when read out noise trades out with the sky background as the dominant noise source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sources of Poisson noise:\n",
    "The shot noise, dark current noise, and sky background noise are all Poisson processes.  Therefore can draw from a Poisson or Gaussian (large number statistics) distribution with a sigma that is the square root of the mean value for each background source to draw random values for the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For small photon counts, photon noise is generally dominated by other signal-independent sources of noise, and\n",
    "for larger counts, the central limit theorem ensures that the Poisson distribution approaches a Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ratio of signal to photon noise grows with the square root\n",
    "of the number of photons captured, √ λt. <br>\n",

    "By the Central Limit Theorem, the Poisson distribution can be approximated as a Gaussian ( http://www.socr.ucla.edu/Applets.dir/NormalApprox2PoissonApplet.html ): <br>\n",
    "if X $\\sim$ Poisson($\\lambda$) $\\Rightarrow$ X $\\approx N(\\mu = \\lambda,\\sigma = \\sqrt\\lambda )$ \n",

    "\n",
    "### Read out noise:\n",
    "The read out noise is a Gaussian process, therefore can draw from a Gaussian distribution with a sigma that is the read out noise value given.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> CCD manufacturers measure and report CCD noise as a number of electrons RMS (Root Mean Square).  You’ll typically see it presented like this, 15eˉ RMS, meaning that with this CCD, you should expect to see about 15 electrons of noise per pixel.  More precisely, 15eˉ RMS is the standard deviation around the mean pixel value. <br>\n",
    "( http://www.qsimaging.com/ccd_noise.html )\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that we don't actually know the mean value of the read out noise, so we should center the read out noise at zero (since we can subtract the mean value off in the images).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian_noise = sigma = R\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining noise:\n",
    "We then add the noise in quadrature (error propagation):\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise_total = SQRT ( Poisson_noise ^ 2 + Gaussian_noise ^2 + ... ) = SQRT ( (meanvalue_Poisson) + R^2 + ...)\n",
